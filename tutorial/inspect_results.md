### Inspect results



![image-20211011151908487](./resource/workflow.png)



After running SyzScope for the first time, it generated a main `work` folder under the project folder. Please check the detailed structure of main `work` folder on [Workzone Structure](./workzone_structure.md).



The workflow of SyzScope shown above. Each component has their own output folder.

Fuzzing's output folder is `output` 

Static analysis's output folder is `static-xxx`

Symbolic execution output folder is `sym-xxx`



If a bug has been turned into high-risk by either fuzzing or symbolic execution, it will be moved to `succeed` folder under main `work` folder.



Normally, we only need to check the `output` and `sym-xxx` under `succeed` folder. By inspecting `repro.report`, we can find if a bug has been turn to high-risk through fuzzing. And `sym-xxx` shows the results from symbolic execution, the final report is printed on the bottom of `symbolic_execution.log` file.
